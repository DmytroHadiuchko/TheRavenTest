# Customer Management API
This project is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API
for managing customer data. It includes basic CRUD operations 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the Customer entity.
The application uses a relational database to persist customer data.

## Ô∏èTechnologies and Tools
### Backend:
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the backend services.
- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building production-ready applications quickly, providing features such as dependency injection, web frameworks, and data access.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access and management using the Java Persistence API.
### Database:
- **MySQL**: A widely-used open-source relational database system, 
chosen for its reliability, ease of use, and support for complex queries 
and transactions.

### Development Environment:
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: An integrated development environment for Java development.
- **Postman: A tool** for testing APIs by sending requests and receiving responses.
